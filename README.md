# Neural Machine Translation Methods for Translating Text to Sign Language Glosses

This repository provides complementary material to aid the replication of the experiments described in the thesis work of  [Neural Machine Translation Methods for Translating Text to Sign Language Glosses].


## Introduction


## Content 

The structure of the repository is as following:

 * `Data`: the plain-text versions of the paraller corpora for both the DGS and the Phoenix corpora. It includes the training, dev and test split for both the Phoenix and DGS corpus. Additionally, one can find lemmatized, alphabet normalized and augmented versions as reported in the thesis.  
 * `Training Scripts`: bash files including SLURM commands to execute Marian-NMT for training the NMT transformer models.
 * `Human Evaluations`: streamlit-based evalution interface for collecting the human judgements of selected trained systems
 * `Notebooks`: Python notebooks containing the code for reproducing the experiments, 
   *  mapping of lemmatization algorithm and data statistics analysis
   *  statistical analysis for the results of human evaluation


Please note that the corpora ([Phoenix 2014T](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX-2014-T/) and [DGS Corpus](https://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/meinedgs/ling/start_en.html)) have their own licenses and any use of them should be conforming with them and include the appropriate citations.
